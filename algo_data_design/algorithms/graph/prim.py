    Algorithm to create a tree from a graph containing all its nodes, the sum of the edges of this tree

        - Traveling Salesman Problem approximation
        - Circuit / Network design
        - Cluster Analysis
    Indicated for: Dense graphs
    Time Complexity: O(vË†2), where v=vertices and e=edges
